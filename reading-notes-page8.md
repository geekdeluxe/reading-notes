# JavaScript Neat Stuff Continued

##Control Flow
+ The order in which the computer carries out commands in a script (the chronology of command completion).
+ Just as the English language is read left to right, a computer also exectutes commands from a script in a certain order.
+ Conditionals (sets of rules) and loops (sequences of instructions which run on repeat until certain criteria are met)
  are things that can change the control flow (and this can happen often).

##Functions
+Foundational tools in JS
+ A code block created to do a specific thing (similar to a procedure).
+ Functions are executed when called or evoked by something. 
+ Functions must be defined or declared 

##Expressions
+ An expression is a working unit of code that resolves to a specific value (the value it was designed to resolve to).
+ Expressions can have side effects (extra features such as assigning values), or strictly evaluate and nothing else. 

##Operators 
+ Syntax used to carry out a computation, such as assign value (=), add (+) and multiply (*)
+ There are LOTS of operators in JS:
        +Assignment - assigns value 
        +Comparison - compares two data points (operands) and returns the intended value based on a true comparison 
        +Concatenation - joins two strings together without changing either, yet produces a new string. Pretty cool. 
        +Arithmetic - uses numbers as operands and returns a numerical value
        +Bitwise - uses the binary numerical system (ones and zeros) with operands representing a set of 32 bits, but returns standard numerical values 
        +Logical - usually used with Boolean logical values
        +BigInt - (confusing) and used for numbers that aren't objects and are so large they aren't represented by primitive values
        +String - any values in JS which are enclosed in single or double quotation marks 
        +Conditional (ternary) - takes 3 operands (and is the only JS operator which does this). Can have one of two values based upon a condition. Diva! 
        +Comma - evaluates two operands and returns the value of the last operand. Only use it for inside loops. Bad form to use it elsewhere.
        +Unary - an operation with only one operand, such as "delete"
        +Relational - compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on the truth of the comparison. Pretty neat.
