# Revisions & The Cloud (Git Intro)

## A Version Control System (VCS) is a system which lets the user see and revisit the versions and history of a file or file set. This is especially neat because changes and progress are easily trackable. With VCS, code errors are easily fixable. Git is also excellent for collaborating with other software developers, teams, and stakeholders. Version Control technology was a huge breakthrough, as it takes a ton of pressure off of the developers and other collaborators. It's an important safeguard and something to be thankful for.

## There are a few different kinds of VCS: local (LVCS), centralized (CVCS), and distributed (DVCS). Local is old-school, centralized is risky, and distributed is the way to go: 
  

  + Git is a DVCS (distributed version control system) that stores data similar to snapshots. Each change or "commit' prompts a snapshot, and those   snapshots are stored and available for reference.
    The great thing about a DVCS is that it allows users to create a backup, or a mirrored repository (repo), which can be used if a Centralized Version Control System (CVS) data is lost. 
  
  + Git was created by Linus Torvalds, chief architect of Linux.
