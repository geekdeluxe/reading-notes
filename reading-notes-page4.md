# Revisions & The Cloud (Git Intro)

## Version Control is a system which lets the user see and revisit the versions (history) of a file or file set. With VCS, mistakes are easily fixable. Git is also excellent for collaborating with other developers, teams, and stakeholders. 
  

  + Git is a DVCS (distributed version control system) that stores data similar to snapshots. Each change or "commit' prompts a snapshot, and those snapshots are stored and available for reference.
    The cool thing about a DVCS is that it allows users to create a backup, or a mirrored repository (repo), which can be used if a Centralized Version Control System (CVS) data is lost. 
  
  + Git was created by Linus Torvalds, chief architect of Linux.
