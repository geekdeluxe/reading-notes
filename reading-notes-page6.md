# CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's the "dressing" of a website, and what adds decoration and style to the page.
CSS uses curly braces { } and does not need to be typed in any certain order. For example, you can make changes to the header, the background color of your website, and many other elements without adhering to any chronological order when typing the code out.
W3Schools is a great resource for CSS
