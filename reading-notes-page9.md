# Operators & Loops

## Operators 
+ Operators are the syntax, such as + and - that join complex expressions together.
+ There are several types of operators (as noted on my reading notes page 8), but comparison and assignment are probably the most important.
+ Assignment operators assign value to its left operand, based on the value of its right operand.
+ There are compund assignment operators, which are a form of shorthand.
+Comparison operators run a comparison based on operands and retuns a value based on the truth of the comparison.
+Operands for comparison operators can be numerical, string, object, or logical.


## Loops
+ Loops are a simple and fast way to do something repeatedly in code.
+ There are many kinds of loops in JavaScript, but the most common ones are "for statements" and "while statements".
+ A "for" loop repeats until the specified condition evaluates to false.
+ You can execute multiple "for" statements by using a block statement to group the various statements. 
+ A "while" loop will run as long as the specified condition evaluates to true.
+ False conditions will cause the for loop to stop executing and control will pass to the statement following the loop.
