# Opening Statement

The topic of JS Canvas and Chart.js is important because these tools allow developers to easily display charts on their web pages, which are also easily customizable. These can be animated and are dynamic visual displays which further engage the viewer. Telling a story visually with data is generally more convincing and also more understandable for the audience. This becomes even more important in business use cases. 

# JavaScript Canvas

- The canvas property allows the developer to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

- The importance of the closing /> canvas ag is that it's required. Also, content between the opening and closing tags only displays if the browser doesn't   
  support the  canvas  element.

- According to javascripttutorial.net, the getContext() method returns a render context object.

# Chart.js Documentation

- Chart.js is a really handy open-source charting library for JavaScript. It can be brought into my project by customizing it to display the data from the 
  clicks and names of the Odd Duck products.

- 3 different chart types from Chart.js are: area chart, bar chart, and doughnut and pie charts. 

# Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js

- Some advantages to displaying data via a chart vs a table are readability and efficiency for the developer and end user, and ease of customization by the 
  developer.

- Chart.js could aid my previously created applications visually because charts are more easily understandable than tables. Charts are simply a more 
  efficient and visually striking way to display data than using a table. Also, using Chart.js saves a lot more time than having to code up a table in HTML and fussing around with the table head, foot, rows, etc.
