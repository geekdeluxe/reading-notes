# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout 

This topic matters because it directly ties in to what the 201 class is studying in this module. HTML, JS, and CSS are all needed to make a great website (or even a halfway decent website). These languages work together and are linked together. There are a ton of tips and tricks to know with each one, so continuous learning of each is imperative.
