# Opening Statement

This topic is important because debugging your code is a crucial to writing clean code. Humans aren't perfect, and in many ways, technology helps us find and fix our faults. Debugging will be a valuable skill which will save a lot of time in the present and future. I'd like to think debugging will also allow a developer to become familiar with common errors and with time and experience, those errors will be avoided in the future. 



# What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

    - The two most common errors in code are syntax and logic errors. Syntax errors are errors in the spelling of the code which cause the code not to execute at all or fail to work at some point. Logic errors occur when the text (syntax) is right, but the code doesn't work because there is at least one point where the programmatic logic isn't accurate. Essentially-the instructions aren't clear and the computer is confused. You can have either single or multiples errors of both kinds in your code. 

    - I've been fortunate enough not to encounter many errors in past lab assignments, but I did make a syntax error with a reading notes commit during the ACP process. I checked that I had autosave turned on in VS Code, I reviewed my previous commits in GitHub, and checked to make sure the link to my page was working. This was a process of elimination game, and was quite the mystery.

    - This topic will influence my long term goals because I aim to write clean code, and I'm also interested in learning how to refactor, and especially refactor legacy code. 


# The JavaScript Debugger

    - The JavaScript debugger tool is an extremely useful editing tool which allows developers to review their work look at the valie of variables at certain points. This is kind of like pressing stop and rewind or fast forward when watching a movie. This saves the developers a lot of time and results in better quality code. In Chrome, you can find the debugger by opening the Developer tools and clicking on "Sources." In Safari, do the same thing, but select the "debugger" tab instead.
