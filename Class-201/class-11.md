# Opening Statement

The topic of video and audio content and responsive changes on web pages is crucial because most people are auditory and visual creatures, and appreciate engaging multiple senses when consuming content. Also, video content is a backup for audio, and vice versa. Some users will have vision or hearing impairments, and they need a way to consume and enjoy content as well. There are also users who don't enjoy reading, or may be dyslexic. Video and audio not only add rich context to a story or piece of content, but they are also both succinct forms of communication. Responsive changes have more to do with the kind of screen used to display content, and this is important because users view content on all kinds of devices.

# Video and Audio Content

    - The ability to use video and audio content on the web has evolved since the early 2000s in that now there are so many more features and options available  
      to both the developers and the users. Examples of those are transcription, subtitles, and captions. The technical quality has improved a lot as well.

    - The use of src attribute in the <video> element provides a path to the video embedded. The controls attribute provides the end users a way to have control 
      of the audio and video playback. 

    - It's important to have fallback content inside the <video> element because sometimes the video might not work, or you may have users who are visually 
      impaired.

    - There is a website called World's Web which features users from all over the world, sharing their unique experiences of life. <audio> and <video> are 
      fraternal twins (their parents are <spoken> and <written> words. Like their parents, <audio> and <visual> are both teachers with magical powers, and they follow in their parents footsteps and teach by example. However, thanks to the twin's fresh take on storytelling and learning, World's Web is now the most popular website in all the lands. The visitors are educated, happy, and productive. <spoken> and <written> words are so proud.

# A Complete Guide to Grid

    - According to Greekdforgeeks.org, the CSS Grid layout differs from Flex in that grids help devs create the outer layout of a webpage, and flexbox is mainly 
      used for aligning content and move blocks. CSS grids are for 2D layouts, and flexbox works best in only one dimension.

    - When using CSS Grid, there are a few important terms to understand:
            - grid container is the parent element of the grid layout. According to w3schools.com, an HTML element becomes a grid container when its display   
              property is set to grid or inline-grid. 
            - grid item is a child element of the grid container and is the content placed inside inside the columns and rows in the grid.
            - grid line are the lines between rows in the grid.

# Responsive Changes


    - Besides making a website visually appealing across different screen sizes, developers should make images responsive because it engages the end user, which 
      in turn may spark imagination and helps create a better user experience.

    - srcset is an <img> attribute which defines the images we'll allow the browser to choose between, and the sixe of each image.
    - sizes is an <img> attribute which defines a set of media conditions (such as screen width), and indicates what image size is best to use when certain 
      conditions are true.
