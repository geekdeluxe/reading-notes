# Opening Statement

    The topic of local storage is important because developers need to know about various storage options, how to access them, and determine which storage solutions are best for each occassion. 

# Local Storage and How to Use it On Websites

    - A develper would use local storage for a website application because this allows you to get around having users sign up to use your website, as is the 
      case when a server is involved.

    - Pii (personally identifiable information) and banking/financial info should *not* be stored in local storage, as there are security vulnerabilities 
      associated with local storage, such as Evercookie.

    - Local storage can store strings in the different keys. You can use the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods to get around this.
