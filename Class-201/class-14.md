# Opening Statement

Psychological safety is a new concept for me, and piques my interest a great deal. Unfortunately, I've only heard psych safety discussed in elite tech circles, and I have yet to experience it in business. The classic "open door policy" has been the closest most companies/teams get to psychological safety, and it's not nearly the same thing. Psychological safety means being mindful, open, empathetic, and helpful (aka be a real one). Make sure your teammates have the opportunity to speak up and contribute equitably. Encourage others to be themselves at work. These are all *shared responsibilities* and involve self-awareness, empathy, vulnerability, and social grace. A note on empathy: it's not passive. It's about action. What are you willing to do to demonstrate your empathy for others and elevate the team?

These concepts run counter to the individualistic nature of our society and the traditionally accepted shark-like behaviors in business. In many ways, society reinforces the egregious misconception that emotions/feelings are weaknesses. The opposite is true. Understanding emotions is in fact a strength. Learning to recognize, regulate, and share them when appropritate is a superpower. Historically, women have been criticised for being too emotional, which is bad for business/leadership. I'm pleased to see these misconceptions being dispelled. Humans are emotional creatures and 

The implications for psychological safety are *huge* and there is data to back this up. I believe we create our best work when we're not oppressed in a culture of fear. The opposite of a fear-based culture is a psycholgically safe one. I've had my fair share of toxic work envoronenments, so I truly embrace the possibility of working for a company that practices psychological safety. 

# What Google Learned From its Quest to Build the Perfect Team 

- Three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams are equitable discussions (conversational turn-taking), and higher than average emotional 
  sensitivity (emotional intelligence), and vulnerability.

- I've yet to work in a psychologically safe environment, but my last corportate job was especially toxic. My Director was condesceding, critical, and wasn't 
  invested in getting to know me or helping me to succeed in the role. The company's CEO was asleep at the wheel and very standoffish. There was also nepotism happening left and right, sexism, and departments that did not communicate with one another. There was also no accountability for anyone in leadership. Senior leaders were allowed to behave poorly because they were technically good at their job and made the company money. 

- Teams that operate with a high degree of psych safety have been shown to be top-performing teams where employees value one another and enjoy their work. Note 
  to stakeholders: success isn't easily quantifiable, and immediate ROI and financial gain shouldn't be your only measurements for success.
  that!
