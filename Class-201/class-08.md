# Opening Statement:

CSS is important because end users and stakeholders alike won't be satisfied with boring websites. Also, stakeholders may have very specific requirements for layout and design of their website. CSS is everything to do with how a website looks. This is also tied in to user accessibility in some ways (color choice, for example).


# Readings: CSS Layout 

## Learn CSS- Flexbox

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content, which means the content will be seen as flat on the screen. 

According to MDN web docs, the main axis is set by your flex-direction property, and cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis. 

Using certain properties of flexbox can negatively impact accessibility: according to MDN web docs, properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document. The row-reverse and column-reverse values are good examples of this.



## CSS Layout - Flexbox

According to MDN web docs, some advantages to using flexbox over float are:
    - The ability to vertically center a block of content inside its parent
    - Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of available height/width, regardless of how much width/height is available
    - Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content

This topic connects with my long term goals because I want to learn to build websites and develop software. CSS is not something I expect to master immediately, but I will get better at it with practice.
