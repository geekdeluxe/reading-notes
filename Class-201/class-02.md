# Opening Statement 

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create dynamic web pages. It's impperative web developers have a strong understanding of each, and how they interact. The most common features of each should be studied thoroughly.

# Introduction to HTML

## HTML Text Fundamentals & HTML Advanced Text Formatting

    - It's important to use sematic elements in our HTML because it helps display display content properly.

    - There are 6 levels of headings in HTML <h1> - <h6>

    - Some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements include markup of chemical formuae, mathematical equations, and dates.

    - When using the <abbr> element, you must add the <title> attribute to provide the full expansion of the term.

## How CSS is Structured

    - CSS can be applied to HTML in the following ways:

        - External Stylesheet using a <link> element

        - Internal stylesheet using a <style> element contained inside the <head> of the HTML. 

        -Inline Styles which affect a single HTML element contained within a <style> attribute

    - We should avoid using inline styles because it's not efficient and is a nightmare to edit. Also, using inline styling mixes CSS with HTML and makes everything convoluted and difficult to read/follow. 

    -Regarding the Code Fellows sample code block below:

       h2 {
     color: black;
     padding: 5px;
   }

h2 is represeting the selector.
The color and value and padding and value components are considered CSS declarations.
The color and padding components are considered properties.

# Learn JS

## JavaScript Basics

    -A string is a data type which is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks.

    - 4 types of JS operators are:
        - Addition +
        - Assignement =
        - Strict Equality ===
        - Bang or Not !

    - a real world problem you could solve with a function is calculating totals of cookies sold per hour at your bakery.

## Making Decisions in Your Code - Conditionals 

    - An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true then the code block is executed.

    -The use of an else if satement is for a catch-all 

    -Per MDN Web Docs, && is a logical operator that allows the develper to connect two or more expressions so that each one will have to evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true. The || logical operator allows the developer to connect two or more expressions so that one or more have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
