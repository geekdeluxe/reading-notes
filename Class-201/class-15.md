# Opening Statement

# CSS Transforms

- The CSS transform property allows the developer to size, position, and change elements.

- An example of a transform is a 2D transform and this could be used on a website by rotating an element up to 360 degrees.

# CSS Transitions and Animations

- A CSS transition allows the developer to change the look and behavior of an element whenever a state change happens, such as a user hovering over an element.

- A CSS animation differs from a CSS transition in that animations allow the look and behavior of an element to be changed in multiple keyframes. Transitions 
  provide a change from state to state, but animations utilize several points of transition in multiple keyframes.
