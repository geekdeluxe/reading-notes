    HyperText Transfer Protocol Poem

    HTTP is the coolest
    set of rules
    requests and responses
    which defines a language
    allowing our devices 
    to access information
    which we voraciously consume
    HTTP is the coolest

    HTML, CSS, and JS are parsed in the browser using <link>, <style>, and <script> elements. 

    You can find images to add to a website by googling "public domain images" and looking at the various options available. gettyimages.com is a popular site for this. You can also use your own personal photos by saving an image to your desktop, pictures folder, or dropbox to use. The important thing to remember is to give credit to the source if the photo is copywrited, not a personal photo, or not in the public domain.

    You can create a string vs a number in JS by using text instead of numbers and surrounding your string wiuth single quote marks (numbers don't have quotes surrounding them). 
    
    This is an example of a string in JS: 
    let myVariable = 'String';

    This is an example of a number in JS:
    let myVariable = 8;

    A variable is collection of values. Variables are defined then assigned value by the programmer. They're essential to do anything noteworthy in programming because they suppoprt dynamic actions.
