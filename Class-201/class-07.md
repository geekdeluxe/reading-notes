# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables 

Opening Statement: this topic is important because it provides a useful way to organize and display data. Data is most useful when it's easily quantifiable and tells a story visually. HTML tables provide a rigid and easily understandable way to do both.


## Domain Modeling

 Is the practice of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific/special problem. Domain modeling is important because it's understood by both developers and stakeholders. It's one of several visual models used by business analysts in the requirements gathering process. 


## HTML Basic Tables

According to MDN web docs, HTML tables should *not* be used for web page layouts because of 3 reasons:
    - layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users
    - tables produce tag soup (convoluted/messy code)
    -tables aren't automatically responsive like a proper HTML layout is

3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table are:
    - <th> which is the header and specifies the type of data in that row or column
    - <tr> is the table row, which is filled in with data
    - <tfoot> is the footer of the table, where data is quantified



## Introducing Constructors

A constructor is used for creating more than one onject. Some of the advantages to using it are efficiency and ease of refactoring.

The term 'this' differs when used in an object literal vs when used in a constructor in that the constructor useage allows reference to multiple objects rather than just one (as is the case with an object literal)


## Object Prototypes Using a Constructor

An example of prototypes and inheritance from my work experience would be when I was hired on as Salesforce Administrator there was a specific job description and set of business requirements tied to the role. It all seemed seamless and What I inherited was a lot of technical debt and a messy SFDC instance. No one else in the company really knew what the previous admins had done, why, or how to fix the issues I encountered.
