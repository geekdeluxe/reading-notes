# HTML Cont'd

-You should use an unordered list when you don't care about the order of importance of the items in a list.

-You can change the bullet style of unordered list items by using a - or an * or by switching to an ordered list <ol>

Use an ordered list in HTML when you care about the order of importance of the items on a list, or the chronological order. An example would be a list of favorite restaurants. I'd be inclined to put the my favorite at the top of the list. An unordered list is totally random, like a list of side dish options. 

# Learn CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

-The Box Model refers to the fact that *everything* in CSS has a box around it. It's important to understand this because it's the foundation for being able to make content that works well together, is properly aligned, and is functional. 


CSS Properties of the Box Model: 
    * Border - wraps the content and padding
    * Content - area where content shows up
    * Padding - white space around content 
    * Margin - wraps other 3 properties 
      between this box and the other elements. This is the outermost layer.
