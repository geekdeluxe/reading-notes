# Opening Statement:

The topics of HTML media and using color in CSS directly relate to what we are studying in 201 at Code Fellows. Front End and Fullstack Software Developers need to know how to add video and other content to their webpages, as well as styling HTML text elements. The look of a website and the content are both extremely important aspects. 


# HTML Media

-A real world use case for the alt attribute is to describe the content of your image with text (for those who use screen readers or text-only browsers). This is something that improves accessibility.

-You can improve accessibility of images in an HTML document by using alt and describing the image via text.

-A gif image provides animation in simple form. They are usually fairly quick and repeat on loop. An svg image type is what you want to use for large images, such as icons and diagrams, according to MDN Web Docs. 

-You'd display a screenshot on your website using image type PNG because this will offer you the most clear duplicate of the original image. It's actually preferable to JPEG

## Using Color in CSS

-The difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element

-If a friend asked me to touch up his blog with some color, I'd ask what his favorite colors are and which ones he does not like at all. I'd then review the accessibility guidelines regarding color choices on websites. Lastly, I'd use the CSS color picker and/or CSS-tricks.com for options.

## Styling HTML Text Elements

-When choosing fonts for an HTML document, you should consider the following: 

-Font-size, font-weight, and font-style all change HTML text elements in their own way, and are all common CSS styling features.

-Two ways you can add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element include using letter-spacing and word-spacing, which are examples of text layout styles.
