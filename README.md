My Reading Notes for Code Fellows 

> The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. -Albert Einstein 

#### Hi there! My name is Jennifer Kelly (she/her), and I'm an expeditious professional, Salesforce devotee, and budding techie.  


At Code Fellows, students learn to embrace the growth mindset. For me, it's the foundation for lifelong learning. It's about looking at the brightside, perservering forward, finding solutions, being creative, and not giving up.
