# Choosing a Text Editor 

## For now, I'll focus on GitHub's Atom and Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. I'm eager to learn more about them! 
###Thanks to The Older Coder for the following info re Atom: 

  **GitHub's Atom**
  +Host and review code on GitHub
  +Get help with your projects!
  +Hackable? 
  +Learn about Emmmet (a useful Syntax for writing HTML). Install if not already built into Text Editor
  +Code Completion is something to be truly thankful for. This is autofill for code. Remarkable stuff :)
  +Syntax Highlighting (this feature colorizes text to reduce eye strain while coding).
  
  
  ***Microsoft's Visual Studio Code**
  +Emmett is built in
  +Syntax Highlighting
  +Autosave!!
  +Themes Available
  +Code Completion (even includes closing tags and brackets when opened)
  +Lots of extensions available
