# HTML 

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it's the code which is used to structure (format) web pages and the content on the web pages

An opening tag in HTML is aligator bracket < and the closing tags are a forward slas with a closing alligator bracket />

There is generally a specific formatting structure to follow when writing HTML, but code editors such as VSCode will honor this structure. It usually looks a bit like this:


          <html>
              <head></head>
              <body>
                   <header></header>
                   <main></main>
                   <footer></footer>
              </body>
          </html>
          
          
Some important things to remember about using HTML are:

+ Use section vs div. Use semantic elements when possible
+ You can nest HTML elements (one command inside the other), just be sure to close each element with a /> closing tag 
+ Use tab in VSCode to autocomplete
+ Wireframing is a visual layout (starts rough then usually gets more refined with each revision)
+ Wireframing resources are Invision, Google Drawings, Miro, and Wireframe.cc
