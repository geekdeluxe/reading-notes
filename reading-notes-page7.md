# JavaScript

JavaScript (not to be confused with Java), is the code used to make web pages functional and interactive. You can also use it to get data from users.
The central driving force in JavaScript are objects, which are collections of properties. 
A property consists of an association between a name, or key and a value. For example, myDreamCar is an object and Chevy (the nake) Chevelle (the model) are properties associated with the object myDreamCar. Just imagine the possibilities. 
JavaScript uses conditional logic, and one click of a button (a form submission from an end user, for example), can set off an entire workflow of events behind the scenes.
Standard JavaScript scripts contain many conditionals, loops, and functions, all of which are all used to control the flow of information and chain of events.

## JavaScript Need to Know:

+ JavaScript uses expressions, which are similar to mathematical expressions. Essentially, they are units of code that resolve to a value. Some expressions can assign values, and some purely evaluate information.
+ Complex expressions use symbols such as = and + which are called operators. 
+ When coding JavaScript, it's important to be mindful and consider both the end user and the overall goals behind your website. Think holistically and  
  don't overcomplicate things.
+ It's best to keep your JavaScript in a separate file, usually labelled app.js or something similar.
+ <script> tags runs JS.
+ A string in JS (similar to a mathematical expression) has double quotation marks, but text values do not. 
+ Declare a variable using let or const (constant). Var is not used for anything newer than 2015
+ Console.log is a separate windown in a browser, (usually hidden to non-devs), which what data is in each variable at the moment. This feature is used by   devs to check for bugs.
+ a fancy trick is "string concatenation," which joins 2 or more strings without changing the existing strings, but returns a new string. That's neat!
+ JavaScript = alegebra skills. More specifically, it's a language that uses conditional logic such as if, if else, and and else statements.
+ Example: // if (this is true) {do this code}
+ In JS, the = sign is used to assign value. A == means kind of the same, and === means strictly the same.
+ Else statements are used for anything that isn't specified with statements like else if and/or else.
