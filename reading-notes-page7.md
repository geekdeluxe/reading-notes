# JavaScript

JavaScript is the code used to make web pages interactive. 
The central driving force in JavaScript are objects, which are collections of properties. 
A property consists of an association between a name, or key and a value. For example, myDreamCar is an object and Chevy (the nake) Chevelle (the model) are properties associated with the object myDreamCar. Just imagine the possibilities. 
JavaScript uses conditional logic, and one click of a button (a form submission from an end user, for example), can set off an entire workflow of events behind the scenes.
Standard JavaScript scripts contain many conditionals, loops, and functions, all of which are all used to control the flow of information and chain of events.

## JavaScript Need to Know:

+ JavaScript uses expressions, which are similar to mathematical expressions. Essentially, they are units of code that resolve to a value. Some expressions can assign values, and some purely evaluate information.
+ Complex expressions use symbols such as = and + which are called operators. 
+ When coding JavaScript, it's important to be mindful and consider both the end user and the overall goals behind your website. Think holistically and don't overcomplicate things.
